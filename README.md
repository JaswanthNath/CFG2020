# Code For Good 2020
Our project is to provide a user-friendly platform to capture data and to display it on intuitive dashboard.

## Issue
In this project we had to make user-friendly platform, which enables the field teams to capture data on pre-loaded and customizable questionnaires with ease. The captured data should then be displayed on an intuitive dashboard representing key metrics and insights drawn from the collected data, which can be shared with our internal and external stakeholders.

## Our Solution
Our solution is to capture the data of operations and customizable queries. The captured data is displayed graphically on the automated dashboard.The web application creates forms which can be accessed by admin, users and viewers. These forms can also be edited by admin or anyone with the requisite permission.The data of every project can also be viewed on dashboard by filtering based on location.
